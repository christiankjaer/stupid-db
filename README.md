# StupidDB

LSM-tree based DB in progress. This for me to explore how to build a database.

## TODO. In order.

- Data definition language. How to describe tables.
- In memory implementation and simple query language
- WAL
- Writing data structures to disk
- Secondary indexes
- Concurrency, locking and transactions.
